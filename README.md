**TOPSIS Implementation in Python**

This project implements the TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method in Python, a multi-criteria decision-making technique. The program reads input data from a CSV file, processes weights and impacts, calculates TOPSIS scores, and generates a ranked output file. The implementation includes an overview of TOPSIS theory and ensures robust handling of invalid inputs.

**Key Features:**
-Command-line program with custom weights and impacts.
-Comprehensive validation for input files and parameters.
-Outputs include TOPSIS scores and rankings for decision alternatives.
